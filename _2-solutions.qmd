Visualising these spatial, temporal, and taxonomic gaps, it’s clear that our picture of biodiversity is shaped by patterns of human effort, but it also gives us some idea of where we can direct our efforts to make the biggest difference in filling the gaps.

::: {.notes}
One example of these targeted efforts is the Christmas Beetle Count. Christmas beetles tend to make themselves known in midsummer, often spectacularly, by swarming around lights. In the early 1900s they were said to be so numerous in Sydney that branches of eucalypts would be bent under the weight of beetles. But those annual swarms seem to have disappeared, suggesting that, anecdotally, there may have been a decline. But like many invertebrates, Christmas beetles haven’t been the focus of long-term monitoring, so there aren’t consistent records to tell us if these are natural population fluctuations or not. So Invertebrates Australia and the Australian Museum launched the Christmas Beetle Count, which encourages people across the country to record and upload sightings of these beetles...

...and when we look at the data that’s flowed into the ALA, the impact of the project is pretty clear. There’s a sharp rise in records that aligns with the launch of the project in 2022

::: {.notes}
But what’s also interesting is that there’s been a concurrent rise in records for three other species, which are commonly misidentified as Christmas beetles. So there’s been this spillover effect of inadvertently increasing records for a suite of other non-target beetle species. This is especially significant for the Argentinean scarab, which is an invasive species and was first recorded here around the 1950s. These numbers suggest that the species could be far more common than we might have thought based on records from even just 5 years ago.

The flip side of going out and collecting new records, is making currently available records more accessible. There’s a wealth of data in collections institutions like museums and herbaria, which are in undigitised forms. To address this, the ALA runs a program called the Australian Biodiversity Data Mobilisation Program, which supports projects that improve access to biodiversity data through the ALA. So it’s about making data that we already have, more accessible and discoverable.

One project that was funded through this program is the Museums Victoria Click Beetle project in 2024, where staff digitised over 6,000 click beetle records and uploaded them to the ALA. Prior to the project, the ALA had just over 11,000 records from 63 genera and 322 species of click beetles based on preserved specimens. This project added over 6000 new occurrence records and 1 genus and 60 species that had not been represented in the ALA before.

It’s estimated that there are about 800 species in this group, so we’re still lacking information on more than half the species in this family, but this one project alone was able to increase our species-level data by 18%.

::: {.notes}
This dataset is particularly valuable because differentiation to species level is very difficult for this group, it often requires close examination of small body structures so records based on preserved specimens are likely to be more reliable or better able to be identified to a lower taxonomic rank. This becomes very clear if you look at the breakdown of records based on record type - a lot more of the preserved specimens are identified down to species level, whereas this proportion is lower for human observations. This is an ongoing program that we run every year, and the next round opens in early 2026 so keep an eye on our socials if this is of interest.

## Sharing data is hard...{#xkcd .std data-menu-title="xkcd"}

::: {.notes}
Research data is the other type of biodiversity data that doesn’t always see the light of day. It sits on a hard drive or in the supplementary table of a paper, and is generally inaccessible. And that’s because sharing data is hard - if you want to submit it to infrastructures like GBIF or the ALA, it needs to align with a data standard called Darwin Core. But this isn’t a format that most people are familiar with, so it can be difficult to know where to start.

We built galaxias to help with this - it’s a package in R and Python that steps you through the process of converting data into the right format, putting everything together in the right place, and bundling it all up.

Living Atlases require data to be submitted as a Darwin Core Archive, which is essentially a zip file containing three things: the dataset, metadata, and a schema.

galaxias has functions that will scan your dataset and give you a suggested workflow to meet the minimum requirements. This might involve renaming columns to match standard names, or adding new columns to include particular types of information. These are easily done in existing R and Python workflows.

Once those are done, galaxias automatically builds a schema file and zips everything up into a Darwin Core Archive. galaxias handles all the file conversions and file management through this process, so everything’s always in the right place. Our hope is that this will encourage more researchers to make their data accessible. If you’d like to know more about galaxias, please come and talk to us, Dax and I are at the ALA booth where we have a poster that goes into more detail. And if you’d like to test out galaxias with your own dataset, we’d love to chat about it so please stop by.
