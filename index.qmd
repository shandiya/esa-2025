::: {.notes}
This is Lamprima imberbis, and it belongs to a group of beetles commonly referred to as golden stag beetles, but this species doesn’t have a common name. It’s known from a single specimen that was collected almost 100 years ago. This specimen is a male and was collected from New South Wales, the female is unknown. No information was included about its abundance or ecology, and despite more recent attempts to search for this species, it’s never been recorded again. It is not listed as threatened, and has not had any conservation assessment. It could be extant but endangered, or it may be extinct. It is one species out of many examples I could give that illustrates a widespread and largely unresolved conservation management challenge: how do we address the conservation of poorly known species?

::: {.notes}
Open data infrastructures like GBIF and the ALA are invaluable sources of aggregated data that can be used for developing biodiversity indicators to inform conservation assessments and environemental policy, but they're not immune to gaps and biases. Because the patterns that we see in biodiversity datasets are a reflection of where, when, and what we’ve chosen to observe and record, rather than being an exact copy of the biological world.
